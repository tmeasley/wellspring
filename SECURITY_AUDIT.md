**Audit Date:** October 28, 2025
**Auditor:** Claude (AI Assistant)
**System:** Wellspring Mountain Booking & Property Management System

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was performed on the Wellspring Mountain booking system. The audit identified **1 CRITICAL vulnerability** and multiple security strengths. Immediate action is required to rotate compromised credentials.

**Overall Security Rating:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION**

---

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Exposed Database Credentials in Public Repository

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION
**File:** `migrate_to_turso.py`
**Lines:** 11-12 (in git history)

**Issue:**
Turso database credentials (database URL and auth token) were hardcoded in the `migrate_to_turso.py` file and committed to the public GitHub repository at `https://github.com/tmeasley/wellspring`.

**Exposed Credentials:**
- Database URL: `libsql://wellspring-tmeasley.aws-us-east-1.turso.io`
- Auth Token: `eyJhbGci...` (full JWT token)

**Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone with access to the GitHub repository can read/write to your production database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attackers could view all guest data (names, emails, phone numbers, booking info)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attackers could modify or delete database records
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attackers could create malicious bookings or corrupt property data

**Recommendation:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** rotate the Turso auth token:
   ```bash
   turso db tokens rotate wellspring-tmeasley
   ```
2. Update Streamlit Cloud secrets with the new token
3. Update local .env file with new token
4. The code fix has already been applied (credentials removed from file)
5. Consider removing the entire git history if possible, or at minimum document this incident

**Status:** Code fixed, but token rotation required

## Security Strengths ‚úÖ

### 1. SQL Injection Protection
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE

- All database queries use parameterized statements (`?` placeholders)
- No string concatenation in SQL queries
- Proper use of SQLite parameter binding throughout codebase

**Example:**
```python
cursor = conn.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM lodging_units WHERE location = ? AND is_active = 1",
    (location,)
)
```

### 2. Input Sanitization
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE

- Comprehensive `sanitize_input()` function in `utils/helpers.py`
- Removes HTML/script tags using regex
- Enforces maximum length limits on all text inputs
- Applied to all user-submitted data (names, emails, notes, requests)

**Example:**
```python
def sanitize_input(text: str, max_length: int = 1000) -> str:
    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)  # Remove HTML tags
    text = text.strip()
    if len(text) > max_length:
        text = text[:max_length]
    return text
```

### 3. Authentication System
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE (with minor improvement recommendation)

- Password-based authentication for staff dashboard
- Passwords stored in environment variables/Streamlit secrets (not hardcoded)
- Session-based authentication using Streamlit session state
- Public booking area is intentionally open (no password required)
- Logout functionality properly clears session state

**Current Implementation:**
- Staff password from `STAFF_PASSWORD` environment variable
- Default fallback: `staff123` (only used in local development)
- Session state prevents unauthorized access

### 4. Data Validation
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE

- All booking requests validate required fields before database insertion
- Date validation ensures check-in < check-out
- Email format validation (strips and lowercases)
- Guest count validation (must be positive integer)
- Availability checking before confirming bookings

### 5. Secrets Management
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE (after migration script fix)

- `.env` file properly in `.gitignore`
- `.streamlit/secrets.toml` properly in `.gitignore`
- Database files (`*.db`) properly excluded from git
- Streamlit Cloud secrets used for production credentials
- Template file (`streamlit_secrets_template.toml`) contains no real secrets

### 6. Database Security
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE

- Local database excluded from git repository
- Production uses Turso cloud database (encrypted at rest)
- No database file in public repository
- Connection wrapper properly handles Turso authentication
- Database operations wrapped in try/except for error handling

### 7. Error Handling
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE

- `@safe_database_operation` decorator catches exceptions
- Errors logged but not exposed to users
- Generic error messages prevent information leakage
- Streamlit Cloud redacts detailed error messages in production

### 8. Access Control
**Status:** ‚úÖ SECURE

- Public booking: Open to all (intentional design)
- Staff dashboard: Password-protected
- `require_auth()` function enforces authentication
- Session-based access prevents unauthorized access after page refresh

## Minor Recommendations

### 1. Password Strength (Low Priority)
**Current:** Simple password comparison
**Recommendation:** Consider using bcrypt or similar hashing for staff passwords in future versions

**Not critical because:**
- Password is stored in Streamlit secrets (not in database)
- Only one staff user
- No password database to compromise
- HTTPS encryption protects password in transit

### 2. Rate Limiting (Low Priority)
**Current:** No rate limiting on booking submissions
**Recommendation:** Consider adding rate limiting to prevent spam bookings

**Implementation idea:**
```python
# Track submissions by IP/session
if submissions_in_last_hour > 10:
    st.error("Too many submissions. Please try again later.")
```

### 3. Email Validation (Low Priority)
**Current:** Basic strip and lowercase
**Recommendation:** Add regex validation for email format

**Implementation:**
```python
import re
email_pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
if not re.match(email_pattern, email):
    raise ValueError("Invalid email format")
```

### 4. CSRF Protection (Low Priority)
**Current:** Streamlit handles this automatically
**Note:** Streamlit's built-in session management provides CSRF protection

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
**Current:** Basic logging with Python logging module
**Recommendation:** Consider adding:
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Database operation monitoring
- Error rate alerting

---

## Compliance Notes

### Data Protection
- Guest data (names, emails, phone) stored in database
- No credit card or payment information collected ‚úÖ
- No social security numbers or sensitive identifiers ‚úÖ
- Email addresses stored in plain text (industry standard for booking systems)

### GDPR Considerations (if applicable)
- System collects: name, email, phone, booking dates, special requests
- No explicit consent mechanism (consider adding for EU guests)
- No data export functionality (consider adding "Download my data")
- No data deletion functionality (consider adding "Delete my account")

**Recommendation for GDPR:**
Add a simple privacy policy link and data deletion request process if serving EU customers.

## Conclusion

The Wellspring Mountain booking system has a **strong security foundation** with proper SQL injection protection, input sanitization, and access controls. However, the **critical exposure of database credentials in the public Git repository requires immediate remediation** through token rotation.

After rotating the Turso auth token, the system will meet production security standards for a small-scale booking application.

**Next Steps:**
1. Rotate Turso token immediately
2. Update all environments with new token
3. Monitor for any suspicious database activity
4. Consider implementing recommended enhancements
